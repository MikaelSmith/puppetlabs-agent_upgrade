# == Class: puppet_agent
#
# Upgrades Puppet 3.8 to Puppet 4+ (Puppet-Agent from Puppet Collection 1).
# Makes the upgrade easier by migrating SSL certs and config files to the new
# Puppet-Agent paths and removing deprecated settings that are no longer
# supported by Puppet 4.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [arch]
#   The package architecture.
# [is_pe]
#   Install from Puppet Enterprise repos.
# [package_name]
#   The package to upgrade to, i.e. `puppet-agent`.
# [service_names]
#   An array of services to start, normally `puppet` and `mcollective`.
#   None will be started if the array is empty.
# [source]
#   The location to find packages.
